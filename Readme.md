#### Areas of Improvement
- If I had more time to work on it, below are the features I would like to include.

1. Easy Level - Choice can be given to user to enter whether he wants to play (2*2) or (3*3) with numbers on it.
2. Medium Level - Current working functionality looks good for medium level.
3. Hard Level - When the game starts initially it will show the whole picture for few seconds for player to remember it in mind and then it will divide the picture into cells and scrambled it. Player should remember the picture in mind and then try to assemble it like the original picture.
