# Areas of Improvement

If there is more time, I would like to extend this game with below features:
1. Level of the Game:
    Choice can be given to the player to choose the level of the game: Easy Level (3X3), Medium Level (4x4) and Hard Level (5x5).
2. Option to turn on/off the numbers:
    Now the game is designed with image numbers on top of each image to 
    guide the player. Choice can be given to the player to turn this option on/off.
3. Option to choose the image:
    Currently game is designed with one image specified in the requirement.
    Player can be allowed to choose from a pool of images.
4. Responsiveness:
   Currently game is not responsive on smaller screens but it can be done.
5. Reduce Redundancy:
   Redundancies in the css file can be reduced using SASS.
